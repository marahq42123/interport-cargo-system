1. Modified `Pages/Customer/RequestQuotation.cshtml.cs`

    - After saving, redirect to the list page instead of back to the form.
    - So user can immediately see the request they just created.

    Old line:
    return RedirectToPage("/Customer/RequestQuotation");

    New line:
    return RedirectToPage("/Customer/MyQuotations");

2. New pages/Additions/Modifications

    2.1 Pages/Customer/MyQuotations.cshtml

    Shows the logged in customer all of their quotation requests:
        - Source, Destination
        - Number of containers
        - Package nature
        - Status (Pending, Preparing, Sent, Accepted, Rejected)
        - Buttons: View and Cancel (cancels only when pending)

    Markup:
        Link to create a new one:

            <a asp-page="/Customer/RequestQuotation" class="btn btn-primary">New request</a>

        - Table listing their requests.
        - Small form to post back a cancel.

    
    2.2 Pages/Customer/MyQuotations.cshtml.cs

        Loads the data for the page above:
            1. Gets CustomerId from session (HttpContext.Session.GetInt32("CustomerId")).
            2. If not logged in, send to /Account/Login.
            3. Queries the DB:

                _db.QuotationRequests
                    .Where(q => q.CustomerId == customerId)
                    .OrderByDescending(q => q.Id)

            4. Exposes that list to the razor page.
            5. Also has a POST handler (OnPostCancelAsync(int id)) so the customer can cancel their own Pending request.
            
        - The user can see what they’ve asked for, and what stage it’s in.

 
    2.3 Pages/Customer/QuotationDetails.cshtml

        Shows the details of one request:

            - All the fields from `QuotationRequest` (Source, Destination, containers, package, job)
            - The **status**
            - The **officer message** (from `OfficerMessage`) if set
            - If a real `Quotation` exists for that request, it shows the issued quote (number, date, total, status)
            - A **Back** button to go to `MyQuotations`


    2.4 Pages/Customer/QuotationDetails.cshtml.cs

        Loads a single request for the logged-in customer:

            1. Reads `CustomerId` from session
            2. Finds the request only if it belongs to that customer:

            _db.QuotationRequests.FirstOrDefaultAsync(q => q.Id == id && q.CustomerId == customerId)

            3. Tries to load the **final quotation** from:

            _db.Quotations.FirstOrDefaultAsync(q => q.QuotationRequestId == id);

            4. Passes both to the view

        - This is the page the officer/admin work will plug into; to create/send a quote, the customer will see it here


3. MODIFIED: Pages/Shared/_Layout.cshtml:

    - Inside the navbar <ul class="navbar-nav flex-grow-1"> :

        <li class="nav-item">
            <a class="nav-link text-dark" asp-page="/Customer/MyQuotations">My Quotations</a>
        </li>

    - So the customer can always get to their list, even if they’re not on the request form.

4. Final User Side Flow (SUmmary)

    1. Customer logs in, session gets CustomerId.
    2. Customer goes to Request a Quotation (/Customer/RequestQuotation), fills form, submit.
    3. Page creates a QuotationRequest with Status = Pending and redirects to /Customer/MyQuotations.
    4. My Quotations shows their requests.
    5. Can View one → /Customer/QuotationDetails/{id}
    6. If it’s still Pending, they can Cancel it from the list.
    7. Later, when an officer creates a real Quotation for that request, it will appear on the details page.
